# Meteorite
Welcome to Meteorite! This is a Meteor Project and Repository where I will be using my knowledge so far of Meteor, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make something. If that was kind of vague, basically this is just a playground or testing ground where I can make something in Meteor (whether it be big or small). This repository is also separate from "MeteorTodoApp", which is the repository in which I put my own version of the Meteor Todo App that they teach you in the tutorial. Anyway this is a super long description so I'm just going to end it here haha Thank You for checking out this repository and God Bless!
